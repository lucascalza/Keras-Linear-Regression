# Keras-Linear-Regression
Repository for a machine learning model aimed at achieving a linear regression. All the information about the code are found inside of the notebook.
Implementation of seaborn, pandas, data cleaning, data visualization. The quality of the model is tested with the R2 score from scipy. The score amounts to be around 0.3, which suggests that the model
can be bettered.
